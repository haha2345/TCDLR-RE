# TCDLR-RE

This code is the detailed implementation of *A Novel Tensor Factorization-Based Method with Robustness to Inaccurate Rank Estimation*.

*TCDLR_toy_demo.m* is the implement of TCDLR algorithm without rank estimation for toy data including 4 kinds of size;

*TCDLR_RE_img_demo.m* is the implement of TCDLR-RE algorithm for Berkeley Segmentation Datase(BSD)[1]. *data/small_img.mat* contains 50 random images extracted for the BSD.

*matrix-and-tensor-completion-algorithm/TCDLR_RE_background_modeling.m* is the implement of TCDLR-RE algorithm for background modeling task. We use the *BMnet-2016 dataset* [2] to evaluate our algorithm.
